## Description

Last project of the CPoolDays period

# Solo stumper

Epitech exam's, I passed after 3 different attemps.

You have 4 hours to do your assigment.

Once you pass the solo Stumper you have access to the Duo Stumper

# Duo Stumper

Passed after 7 attemps.

Each duo is created randomly, my duo was someone who cheated on most of his projects and since you don't have access to internet during these assignments...ðŸ˜¢

He quitted after his first year tho :).
